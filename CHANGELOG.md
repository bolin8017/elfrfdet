# Changelog

## [4.1.0] - 2026-05-08

### Removed

- `EvaluateConfig.threshold` field. The field was declared with default 0.5, range [0.0, 1.0], but `maldet.evaluators.binary.BinaryClassification.evaluate()` never used it — `model.predict()` was called directly (= sklearn argmax 0.5). The schema-declared knob silently had no effect on metrics. Removed to match the actual evaluator behavior. If a non-0.5 operating point is needed in the future, bake it into the trained model artifact (see scikit-learn `TunedThresholdClassifierCV`) or implement a custom `Evaluator` protocol implementation in this repo.

### Migration

- New training jobs against this version produce model artifacts that work on lolday with no behavioral change.
- Lolday uses 4.0.0 for any model trained before this bump (manifest lookup is by `detector_version_id`); the legacy schema still surfaces the inert `threshold` field for evaluations on those models. Lolday spec `2026-05-08-submit-job-priority-hparams-threshold-design.md` §6.4 specifies a 2-week grace period before retiring 4.0.0.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-05-02

### BREAKING

- Bumped maldet pin to `>=2.0,<3.0` (maldet 2.0 makes `positive_class` mandatory and reorders the binary CM to a fixed `[Benign, Malware]` axis).
- `maldet.toml [output]`: `classes` is now alphabetical `["Benign", "Malware"]` and a new required `positive_class = "Malware"` field declares which label the detector treats as the positive class. Confusion-matrix orientation in lolday's evaluate / predict views derives from these two fields together.
- `maldet.toml [compat]`: `schema_version = 2`, `min_maldet = "2.0"`. Detectors built with maldet < 2.0 are rejected by the lolday cutover-1 backend.
- No on-disk model carry-over: previously trained `model.joblib` artefacts are not portable across the schema bump because the label encoding now goes through `classes.index(label)` (older artefacts depended on a hard-coded order). Re-train baselines after upgrading.

### Migration

For users embedding elfrfdet:
1. Pin `elfrfdet>=4.0.0` and `maldet[mlflow]>=2.0,<3.0`.
2. If you fork `maldet.toml`, declare `positive_class` explicitly — the platform refuses to build detectors that omit it under `schema_version = 2`.
3. Re-train any saved baselines; old `.joblib` files are not compatible.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-27

### BREAKING

- Bumped maldet pin to `>=1.1,<2.0`. Detectors built with maldet ≤ 1.0 will not be accepted by the lolday phase11e backend (`StageSpec.config_class` and `StageSpec.params_schema` are now required).
- Added Pydantic config classes (`TrainConfig`, `EvaluateConfig`, `PredictConfig`) at `elfrfdet.configs`. `maldet.toml` now references them via `[stages.{stage}].config_class`. `params_schema` is auto-derived at `maldet build` time via `maldet introspect-schema`.

### Migration

For users embedding elfrfdet:
1. Pin `elfrfdet>=3.0.0` and `maldet[mlflow]>=1.1,<2.0`.
2. Pass typed hyperparameters through the platform UI (lolday phase11e) — the JSON Schema is auto-derived; no manual schema upkeep.
3. Manual override via Hydra config remains available for advanced users; the `params_schema` validation is enforced server-side.

## [2.0.6] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- Pins `maldet[mlflow]>=1.0.7` so evaluate/predict skip samples whose
  extractor raises `ValueError` (the train path had this since 1.0.1
  but evaluate/predict didn't). Without it, evaluate/predict crashed
  on the first ELF sample missing `.text`.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- Pulls `maldet[mlflow]` (was bare `maldet`) so the `mlflow` package is in
  the detector image. Without it, `MlflowEventLogger` silently no-ops in
  `log_metric` / `log_artifact`, so platform metrics never reach the
  MLflow tracking server and `runs:/<run_id>/model` is empty — exactly
  what blocked Phase 11d evaluate/predict.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- Pins `maldet>=1.0.6` so the runner uploads the trained model to MLflow as
  `runs:/<run_id>/model` after `trainer.save`. Without this, lolday's
  evaluate/predict model-fetcher init container failed to download the
  source model artifact ("Failed to download artifacts from path 'model'")
  because the artifact only ever existed on the train pod's emptyDir.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- Pins `maldet>=1.0.3,<2.0` (was `>=1.0,<2.0`) so pip cannot resolve to an
  older version. The v2.0.2 build hit a PyPI/CDN propagation race and pulled
  maldet 1.0.2 instead of 1.0.3, which kept the runner on the old
  Hydra-instantiate path and reproduced the "Missing key model" failure.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- Pulls maldet >=1.0.3 transitively. v1.0.3 changes `StageRunner` to load the
  model class from the manifest's `[stages.train].model` symbol instead of
  Hydra-instantiating from `cfg.model._target_`. Unblocks lolday Phase 11d
  E2E, where the params guard forbids `_target_` overrides, leaving the
  v2.0.0/v2.0.1 train path crashing with `ConfigAttributeError: Missing key
  model`. No source changes here — bump exists to retrigger the lolday build
  pipeline against the patched framework.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- Pulls maldet >=1.0.2 transitively, which now skips per-sample feature-extractor
  ValueErrors (e.g. ELF samples lacking `.text` for `Text256Extractor`) instead of
  aborting the whole train run on the first bad sample. No source changes here —
  bump exists to retrigger the lolday build pipeline against the patched framework.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-26

### Breaking

- Full rewrite on top of [maldet 1.0](https://pypi.org/project/maldet/).
- Removed: v0 `BaseDetector` ABC, `ElfRfDetectorConfig` pydantic model, per-detector `elfrfdet` CLI.
- Package layout changed: `src/elfrfdet/{cli.py, config.py, detector.py, text256.py}` deleted; new `src/elfrfdet/{features.py, models.py}`. `from elfrfdet.detector import ElfRfDetector` and `from elfrfdet.text256 import …` no longer work.
- Configuration is now Hydra YAML + `maldet.toml`. CLI is `maldet run train|evaluate|predict --config <yaml>`.
- Dockerfile expects build-time args (`MALDET_NAME`, `MALDET_VERSION`, `MALDET_FRAMEWORK`, `MALDET_MANIFEST_B64`, `GIT_COMMIT`) emitted as OCI image labels — required by lolday's build pipeline (image-label contract).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-21

Final v0 release on the `islab-malware-detector` framework. Deprecated.
